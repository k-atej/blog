This lab was a little bit confusing, but overall was pretty cool and definitely very relevant to the project. It was pretty confusing to deal with the dotnet update, since we couldn't quite figure out why things weren't working for awhile. The second half of the tutorial was probably the easiest part. We felt like the opening of the tutorial was a bit unclear and it made it kind of hard to start. 

We ultimately did the work together in the library. We got a bit stuck on the first night, but we worked it out on the second by restarting completely. While it was annoying to start over the next day, it was refreshing to not have to deal with the same errors over and over again. 

We built the lab while sitting at the same table, so our communication was mostly in-person. We did a lot of troubleshottiung, so we definitely built skills in problem-solving and talking out bugs. We also had to build communication skills regarding scheduling our meeting times in the library, especially after having to restart.

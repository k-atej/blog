The easiest parts of the tutorial were the parts concerning the HTML. I feel like I have a pretty goood understanding of HTML and CSS at this point, and it was cool to see those things in practice in a more complex website like this one. At this point, I'm not sure that I understand how a lot of the C# works, but I do feel like I know how to manipulate it to make it do what I want it to do. 

Working with multiple tables was a little bit confusing due to the sheer number of files that were required for each page, for each set of tables, but it wasn't too bad. I didn't encounter any weird errors during my lab, which may have been fortunate. Our team project is going to have more tables, which might be a little bit more confusing, especially since my understanding of plant phylogeny is less than ideal. That said, I feel pretty ready to go ahead and get started on the project. The only way to figure it out is to try!

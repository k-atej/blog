For Lab 8, I used a Razor framework to create a website to track books! I've always been an avid reader and have kept track of what I've read through a variety of different websites, such as GoodReads. 

The easiest parts for me were the HTML changes. It was fairly easy for me to understand what was being changed/added at each part of the tutorial, since I have some familiarity with it. It was more difficult for me to work with an of the .cs files, because I'm completely unfamiliar with the syntax. It was a bit confusing trying to both understand what was going on with the syntax and the actual website. I picked a pretty similar subject to track in my website, so nothing was too difficult to translate. I just had to remember to preserve the order of the Author after the Title on each of the pages. 

The Jekyll framework differed from Razor in that the Jekyll page was static. There was no database attached to any of the sites. I have to manually add any posts that I want to show up on the blog. They are similar in that they provide something for a programmer to work off of, which lowers the effort needed to do basic tasks. 

I would feel fairly confident in making another Razor application, because I know how to troubleshoot it now. I'm not sure that I fully understand what is going on with every part of it, but that's fine with me. I can just build off of it to create something new.

Setting up this blog really wasn't that difficult, but installing Ruby was a whole different beast. Why do Macs come with Ruby if you can't update it? I would love to know who thought of that. 

To my own credit, updating and troubleshooting Ruby forced me to learn about several different systems that are installed on my computer. I learned a lot about Homebrew, because I had to completely uninstall and reinstall it through the terminal. I still don't really understand what Ruby is or what it does, but for right now, it's working as it should. 

To get this lab working on my computer I used the following resources:

1. [Homebrew](https://mac.install.guide/homebrew/3.html)
2. [Ruby](https://stackify.com/install-ruby-on-your-mac-everything-you-need-to-get-going/)

I'm looking forward to a lot of this class, but really I'm interested in the database section. I'm a biologist at heart, and I'd love to learn more about how data can be handled.

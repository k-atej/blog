This assignment was pretty cool! There's still a lot of files in this blog that I'm still figuring out, but it's cool to see my CSS changes reflected in the website. I struggle with making anything aesthetically pleasing, so I made very minor changes to the blog to suit my preferences. 

I looked through [this](https://sass-lang.com/guide/) page to get a better understanding of SCSS, and looked through [this](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-css-handbook-a-handy-guide-to-css-for-developers-b56695917d11/) page to remind myself about some CSS features. 

I'm looking forward to learning more about the features of SCSS and how they can be combined as a part of this blog.

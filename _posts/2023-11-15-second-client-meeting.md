As we have started to get into making the project, my role has expanded from just communication with the client into front end development. I set up the meeting with the client and headed the development of our presentation, as assigned by my role as the communicator. 

So far, I have modified the layout of the website to reflect the contents. I modified the HTML and CSS to a green and white colorpalette, since our website is about plants. I also created the search page, home page, and about pages, and am working on adding content to each. 

Going forward, I am working on many of the issues listed on our team github repo, but my main foci are the functionality of the search page and the styling of the website. Since our database does not include pictures and has limited interactivity from the user's standpoint, I am working on making the website more aesthetically pleasing and fun to look at. It's been fun to experiment with hover effects, especially on the home page.

On Wednesday, October 25th, we presented our Mockups to two other groups in the class. 

So far, I have been leading communication with the client, as well as managing any presentations that we give to the class or other groups. I was responsible for about half of the mockup, and I intend to begin working on translating that to HTML/CSS somewhat soon. 

We are meeting this Friday, October 27th, where we will clarify our roles going forward. We intend to have another client meeting in about a week, so we will need to begin creating the final website. My primary role with this website will be on the front end/appearance. I plan to consult with Dr. Willyard and my team members to create an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly UI.
